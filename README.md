# MyUniversityExpenseTracker
University Expense Tracker App for android studio

This is my first ever project using Java and Android Studio, self-taught using the tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org. I was inspired to make it when my 
family was discussing how my sister should keep track of her expenses at university.

The app opens on the registration page where you can add, delete, or log into an account with a password. Once in your account, you are greeted by your main page which displays overall balance, total incomes, total outgoings, top outgoings and incomes, budget, and buttons for seeing long/short events.

Long events are for repeated events such as salary. Short events are for one off events such as buying a new phone. These events can be added on their display page where you can enter a title, select a category, input the amount of money, select date of purchase, and add a description. The budget can be edited such that the time period and amount allowed is chosen by the user.

The aim of this app is to provide a simple, easy way to keep a track of spendings. There is no feature to connect a credit card which, although not as convient, is less of a security risk. Data is stored locally on the device using the SharedPreferences Library.
